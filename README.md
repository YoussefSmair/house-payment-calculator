This project is a beginner-friendly Python program that calculates the down payment required when purchasing a house. The logic is based on whether the buyer has good credit or not: users with good credit pay 10% of the total price, while others pay 20%. The script demonstrates basic conditional statements, variables, and formatted output, making it a useful example for learning core Python fundamentals.
